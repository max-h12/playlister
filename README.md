# playlister
Django web application for analyzing Spotify songs/playlists. Uses calls to Spotify's API to pull in song data, then extrapolates meaningful statistics from song attribute distributions. Because I am using the free tier of Heroku hosting, the site may take ~15sec to load initially.

Site hosted at: https://sptfy-playlister.herokuapp.com/

More info on the API's: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
